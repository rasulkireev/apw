        In my free time, I love to do more web dev. More specifically, I like to develop small and fun projects that help
        me learn new technologies. You can see a list of my projects <a href="https://rasulkireev/projects">here</a>.

        As a programmer, I learned to love writing. I try to write regularly, be it <a href="/tutorials/">
        tech tutorials</a> or about <a href="/articles/">any other topic</a>. An extension of written
        tech tutorials was to start making videos. For that, you can check
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-r4_CjDp4n4O-36rnUe8gg">my Youtube channel</a>.

        I like to experiment a lot. Trying something new is a passion of mine. Some of my recent successes were with
        brewing Kombucha, fermenting different foods, and baking bread. On the failure side of things, I can't keep
        a plant alive for more than a week.
