  <p>
    I like to collect cool links and ideas from various places, and can never be bothered to make some posts out of them.
    Instead of doing that I decided to create separate list pages that will be updated as I run into something interesting.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/favourites">Favourites</a></li>
    <li><a href="/project-ideas">My Project Ideas</a></li>
    <li><a href="/free-books-and-courses">Free Books and Courses</a></li>
  </ul>
