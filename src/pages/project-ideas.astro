    <p>If you are a developer you konw this problem well: you have a million ideas for projects, but you don't have time to build all of them.</p>
    <p>So, I decided that instead of having them collect dust in Todoist, Obsidian, Google Keep, Google Sheets, and god knows where else, I will write them down here and share them with you.</p>
    <p>Feel free to steal them!</p>
    <p>If you have some comments, ideas or questions, please <a href="mailto:kireevr1996@gmail.com">let me know</a>!</p>
