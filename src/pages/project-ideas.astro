    <p>If you are a developer you konw this problem well: you have a million ideas for projects, but you don't have time to build all of them.</p>
    <p>So, I decided that instead of having them collect dust in Todoist, Obsidian, Google Keep, Google Sheets, and god knows where else, I will write them down here and share them with you.</p>
    <p>These are sorted by how much I like these ideas, but that is obvioulsy a changing matter.</p>
    <p>Feel free to steal them!</p>
    <p>If you have some comments, ideas or questions, please <a href="mailto:kireevr1996@gmail.com">let me know</a>!</p>

    <h2>Know Thy Self</h2>
    <p>Let user connect various sources to get all their comments, posts and thoughts. Load them into db as a centralized location for all their thoughts. This will allow to do fun stuff like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a prompt for ai that will be hyper specific to that person this helping ask personal questions</li>
      <li>give recommendations to that person on various things: events , books, games, gifts</li>
    </ul>
    <details>
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-800">Additional notes</summary>

      <ul>
        <li>Social Media Comments: Hacker news, Reddit</li>
        <li>personal website sitemap</li>

        <li>note taking apps (google keep, obsidian)</li>
        <li>conversations with ai (chatgpt, claude, perplexity, typingmind)</li>
        <li>save-it-later apps (reader, instapaper) to give insight into what type of stuff you read</li>
