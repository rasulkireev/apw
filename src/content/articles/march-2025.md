## Major Themes

### 1. Balancing Work and Life
Throughout March, I found myself constantly navigating the balance between my professional responsibilities at Readwise, family obligations and my personal creative endeavors. I guess this is nothing new and will be the same from month to month. I will try to mention this less in the future updates. The hardest part, mentally was dealing with my son's and my wife's illness. It has been going on for the majority of March and is still occupying me in April.

### 2. The Rome Planning Adventure
My company Readwise is organizing an offsite in Tuscany, Italy in April. I decided to give my wife and I a treat and extend the Italy trip for both of us. So it will be a week with my awesome colleagues and an additional week with my amazing wife. Very exciting. Thanks a ton to my mother and sister for taking care of my son while we try to recharge out batteries. I have spent some time planning the trip for us, which was a bit laborious but extremely exciting. Planning trips gives me a lot of joy.

### 3. Entrepreneurial Momentum
March wasn't a month of huge developments in my projects except for one exciting event. First big payment from CodeRabbitAI to sponsor them on Built with Django. They have also agreed to pay for a sponsored post, which is very exciting. This isn't life changing money, but definitely exciting and though provoking. Thinking of other ways I can monetize this site.

## Readwise Work Highlights

### Integration Improvements and Debugging
A significant portion of my month involved enhancing various Readwise integrations, particularly the Roam API. Early in the month, I made a breakthrough by finally getting Roam to work locally - a victory after considerable troubleshooting. I then focused on creating a smoother upgrade flow for users transitioning to the Roam API, including detailed documentation and visual guides.

It felt overwhelming at times, since i'm still learning how all the integrations work and each user issue means exploring new part of the codebase. Plus, the inherent nature of working on 3rd party integrations means dealing with external outages, api changes and bugs. Hopefully, I get to efficieny level that will allow me to fix issues quickly soon. Otherwise, spending hours on things that would take others mintues to solve is demoralizing.

Readwise the product is amazing. Readwise the employer is fantastic. I just want to repay the chance they gave me by hiring me instead of more qualified and experienced candidates with efficiency and results.

### Data Analysis and Monitoring
I dedicated significant time to improving our monitoring systems, adding numerous charts to New Relic dashboards for better visibility into system performance. This involved writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from our data, tracking everything from export statuses to integration upgrades.

One particular area of focus was analyzing Instapaper API usage patterns. Apparently we were killing them with our API usage... Unfortunately I spent a good chunk of time on this, which doens't affect anyone but them. A little annoying, but almost done.

## Personal Life Highlights

### Side Projects

#### Built with Django
Built with Django continues to grow steadily.
I published another newsletter and added several new projects to the showcase.
The most exciting development was securing a $500 sponsored post from CodeRabbit AI!
This was a validating moment, proving that my content creation efforts can generate real revenue.
It's opened my thinking about approaching other companies like Sentry for similar partnerships, potentially expanding into video content as well.

#### Marketing Agents
I made several improvements to my Marketing Agents project this month. Key developments included:
- Refactoring several core methods
- Starting work on a Pricing Agent feature
- Adding competitor analysis capabilities using Perplexity API
- Creating Metabase charts for better analytics
- Improving AI prompts by switching to Gemini

The system isn't quite where I want it to be yet - I noted some frustrations with both the user experience and developer experience - but it's steadily improving.

#### Git Newsletter
A new project emerged from my thinking about using AI to analyze repository changes.
I purchased the gitletter.com domain and generated a new codebase using Pegasus.
While still in early stages, I'm excited about the potential to create valuable insights from code changes.

### Travel Planning
The upcoming Rome trip with Tanya became a focal point for planning.
I booked the Keymaster Vatican tour for April 12th, secured accommodations, and arranged transportation.
I even spent time researching shopping and sightseeing opportunities, carefully marking potential stops on our map.
I reached out to several places about visiting Casino dell'Aurora (Villa Ludovisi), which required some persistence.

The anticipation of exploring Rome together has been a bright spot throughout the month, giving us something wonderful to look forward to
