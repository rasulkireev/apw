description: In this post, I want to publicly list all my 2025 goals. This will help keep me accountable and more structured. Though I doubt I will be consulting it often.

My 2024 Annual Review was a little all over the place. I think this is due to lack of goals set in the beginning of the year. I'm going to avoid this mistake this year. Here are my goals for 2025.


## Health

Health is going to be a huge part of 2025 for me. I think if I prioritize this the rest will fall in place.

- Sleep!!! Give Theo's early rise at 5:30-6:30, bedtime should be around 9pm! No way around that. Even if it is not me waking up, still the same. That way I get more energy to do other things.
- Slowly and methodically reduce sugar consumption. Right now the main culprits are Yoghurt with sugar, after dinner dessert... And munching on shit food when good food is available in the fridge.
- Physical Activity. This should include morning exercise with Theo. Fighting training twice a week and weightlifting twice a week.

## Work

These are less quantifiable on more feel based. For instance the last 2 weeks of January have been much better than the first 2.

- Complete tasks on dev planning!
- Do work that will help me and others in the future (such as log charts on new relic, documentation)
- Be proactive about fixing bugs that are easy to fix

## Family
- Be more proactive about my relationship with Tanya. I think [[The Way of the Superior Man]] is a fantastic source for that!
- Continue spending time with Theo! I've been pretty good with that in 2024.

## Personal Work

I don't have a lot of time to work on side projects unfortunately. This became apparent in my experiment to put them on pause for two weeks to see how this reflects my work and I was much happier with my progress.

I'm not ready to stop my pursuit of creating my own business, so I will continue working on them. Though I need to be smart about it, here.

Now that I have stabilized my work work, I'm slowly going to insert more Side Project work, bit by bit. Here are some things to keep in mind.

- Work on highest potential projects (preferring the existing ones)
- Automate the process as much as possible!
- Prefer working on marketing.
- When coding, work on highest impact tickets.


## Learning

- I'm not going to put any specific tech to learn in 2025. I think through the virtue of goals above some things will come naturally. Plus, my previous expserience has shown that interests change during the year. I have no concrete desire to learn anything specific, so I don't need to be too intentional about it. If I had to choose something it would be learning to automate work with AI.
- My reading habit has been pretty good in [[2024 in Review | 2024]], especially when I've been going to bed early. Keep it up in 2025.
- Be a little more consistent with daily logs. Which should help me with consistency on the weekly and monthly logs. Many times during the year I felt like I haven't done much from day to day, later to look at the month and realize that quite a bit was done. I want to reduce this useless feeling of unproductivity.
