description: Feeling burned out? The solution isn't rest—it's momentum. Making progress in any area of your life can break the burnout cycle and get you moving forward again.
---

This year, I decided to wing my annual review. Still no concrete strucutre. Just writing it bit by bit when inspiration strikes.

## Events based on memory
Good reflection exercise. What comes first to your head to get the events that were the brightest. Obvoulsy this can be a liottle biased since you'll get events that were the latest.

- Went to Italy with Readwise.
- Stayed in Rome with Tanya (without Theo).
- Went to Brazil with Tanya and Theo for 2 months to visit Tanya's parents.
- Annual Review at Readwise that didn't go too well.
- USA Visa issues based on poor performance on company lawyers. Couldn't go to USA offsite.
- Theo turned 2.
- Decided to get the Spanish Nomad visa.
- Rebranded TuxSEO twice. SEOBlogBot -> Marketing Agents -> TuxSEO
- Theo started going to Kindergarten again.
- Created Cleanapp based on Justin Duke's request.
- Tried creating an app with Alan, but didn't go anywhere in 2025. Maybe we can do this in 2026?
- Finally have setup a more or less stable way of transferring funds from USA to Russia. Such a pain in the ass.
- Launched TuxSEO everywhere I could.

## Events based on Photos
Photos are great captures of memories and reflecting on them is a great to remind yourself what happened last year. Excluding things that I talked about above.

- Theo's successful potty training. You might ask, why I thought of it, from watching the photos... Well, don't ask.
- F1 in Baku. (Crazy how that did not occur to me in the first section. This was a big whole family trip)
- We did a bunch of "2-of-us" travelling with Tanya this year: Rome, Rio, Buenos Aires.
- open Helicopter ride in Rio was fun

## AI Chats

I use Typingmind to do most of my AI chats. As part of my workflow I regularly export the data (chats, messages, etc.) and load it into local SQLite db. This makes it relatively easy to analyze the conversations I've had. Here is the result.

**Django**
- Lots of Django ORM work: counts/group-bys, index usage, JSONField queries, EXPLAIN/ANALYZE, query performance tuning
- Frequent model-layer refactors: moving logic from views/scripts into model methods; signal handler simplification
- Migration and schema safety: moving models between apps, related_name clashes, data migration failures, implicit indexes
- Building product features: webhooks, integrations, background jobs, admin bulk actions, auth/account models

**Async tasks**
- Heavy focus on task execution correctness: mutex/lock issues, pickle deserialization failures, QueueOnce behavior
- Operational debugging: session timeouts, task status tracking, worker memory/404 incidents, SoftTimeLimit handling
- Better observability for jobs: emitting scheduled/finished logs, adding context to task logs, naming queued tasks
- Evaluating tooling choices: “best Django library for async tasks”, Celery vs Django-Q2 tradeoffs

**Data & analytics**
- Building product analytics queries: DAU/session metrics, cohort breakdowns, event pivots, weekly vs daily aggregation
- Operational reporting: export failure rates, status checker scripts, reader document/source counts
- Query optimization themes: pre-aggregated daily models, index usage verification, formatting results into tables
- Mixing app DB + warehouse: joining user/profile metadata with event/referral/email-send datasets

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- Docker/Compose troubleshooting: hostname resolution, network conflicts, entrypoint issues, TLS handshake timeouts
- Postgres administration: recovery mode, disk space failures, collation mismatch, pg_stat_statements, publications/users
- Hosting/ops platforms in the mix: CapRover, Render blueprints, Fly.io templates, NGINX upstream problems
- Self-hosted tooling experiments: SigNoz, Huginn, Strapi, Paperless-ngx, registries and service wiring

**Integrations & automation**
- Content pipeline integrations: Readwise↔Notion exports, Kindle/Instapaper/Pocket imports, Google Docs processing
- API edge cases everywhere: auth expiry, rate limits (429), token caches/resets, parsing/validation of messy inputs
- Zapier app/webhook design: event types, tag transformations, publishing requirements, REST hook payloads
- Payments & identity: Stripe/dj-stripe webhook handlers and migrations; Allauth social providers and SSO decisions

**AI-assisted content & marketing systems**
- Designing prompt “products”: SEO title generators, content templates, summarization prompts, anti-placeholder safeguards
- Agent/workflow engineering: PydanticAI/DSPy comparisons, multi-agent system prompts, execution contexts
- Building distribution mechanics: content idea buttons, blog UI tweaks, cold email campaign systems for TuxSEO
- Tooling research: AI research/blog generators, “deep research” patterns, automated reporting pipelines

**Personal growth, planning, and career/work well-being**
- Structured reflection: annual reviews, weekly activity summaries, “Friday wins”, resume condensation and work summaries
- Career tension themes: burnout, feedback anxiety, shipping without review, “normal job” vs side project ambition
- Goal-setting and systems thinking: SMART goals, simplicity/dead code philosophy (“Getting Real” inspired threads)
- Life direction exploration: “AI profile summary”, balancing independence vs asking for support

**Travel, culture, and everyday life**
- Deep travel planning: Rome/Florence/Rio/Brasília/Baku itineraries, restaurant selection, tours, logistics
- History/literature/art curiosity: War and Peace/Durant/Great Books, Baroque sites, museum/architecture facts
- Food/cooking experiments: slow-carb/keto meals, recipes, kitchen tools, tea/supplements
- Family/health practicalities: toddlers’ sleep/illness questions, posture, medical report interpretation, small-life troubleshooting

## Notes

This came to me after entering F1 in Baku bullet point in events based on photos. I think my brain does a great job in blocking negative memories from my recall, which is why I have a tendency to focus on the positives and trying to make events positive all the time. Maybe that is how most people brain's work. I wonder what that means and what lessons can be learnt from this.
