## Preface

I was always scared to read this document. I was worried that I will not understand the way that
people wrote ~250 years ago, or even worse just won't have the vocab to understand (English is not my native tongue afterall).

In the end as with many things it turned out to be not that scary, even pleasent I would say.

Two things helped my conquer my fear:

1. The fact that this document was added in Year 1 of the 10 Year Plan proposed by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler.
2. The fact that I had [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/rasul) [Ghostreader](https://docs.readwise.io/reader/guides/ghostreader/overview) helping me along the way was crucial.


## Summary

For anyone who hasn't read this monumental document, here is the gist of it:
- American Colonies (united States of America) got tired of King George III tyranny.
- They think it is their moral duty to the world and god to put all of their thoughts on a document.
- They list all the things that King has done horribly.
- Finally they declare that from the moment of signing this document they are independent.

## Thoughts

It was very interesting to read, knowing a bit of context from [OverSimplified video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzALIXcY4pg).

My only question/lack of understanding was regarding the "all men created equal" message give all the slavery that was going on at the time.
I would love some historian to shed some light on this for me. Seems somewhat hypocrticial.

Other than that is was a great statement from the group that felt they can govern better than their current government.
