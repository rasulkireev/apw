Not too long ago I have [started a 10 year long journey to read great books](/10-years-of-great-books). It's been a pleasant journey thus far. I'm definitely behind on the plan, but that's fine, I've been reading both older ('great') and newer books. I originally came across that plan in the "How to Read a Book" book by [Mortimer Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler), which I almost finished and am about to write a review on.

Well, this time around I noticed there was a reference to another book compilation called "[Gateway to Great Books](https://www.amazon.com/Gateway-Great-Books-10-Set/dp/B000K078GY/ref=sr_1_1)". This is very similar to the "Great Books of the Western World" series, but with works that are simpler/shorter. I thought it would be a good idea to start reading some of them too.

So, in this post I will be listing the works I'll be reading to keep track of my progress. As with the 10 Year Reading Plan, I'll be leaving links to the online resources where you can read these books for free, as well as links to the posts where I review/summarize/leave my thoughts on the book.
