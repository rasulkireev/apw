This is pretty much Bon Appetit's Buttermilk Pancakes recipe, but with a few tweaks, mainly reduction of sugar.

Ingredients:
- 1.3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1.5 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1.25 cups buttermilk (can be replaced with Kefir or any other sour milky liquid)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Steps:
1. Mix flour, baking soda and baking powder in a bowl.
2. Mix eggs, buttermilk, sugar, salt in a separate bowl (doesn't have to be large) until sugar dissolves.
3. Pour the liquid into the bowl with flour and mix (don't over do it, lump are ok).
4. Melt and add the butter to the mix. __Tip: cover with something to avoid butter being everywhere__.
5. Fry with a bit of oil in a pan. Turn, when the top part is no longer liquidy and is covered with bubbles.
