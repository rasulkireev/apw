My Wife's Favorite Breakfast. 99% the credit goes to [Joshua Weissman](https://www.joshuaweissman.com), since I basically use [his recipe](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/perfect-homemade-waffles). I make just a couple adjustments, most notable: sugar redaction.


Ingredients:
- 225g mochiko flour
- 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
- 180 grams of milk
- 1 egg
- 30g sugar
- pinch of salt
- 2 tablespoons (28g) melted unsalted butter

Steps:
1. Mix flour and baking soda in a bowl.
2. Mix eggs, milk, sugar, salt in a separate vessel (doesn't have to be large) until sugar dissolves.
3. Pour the liquid into the bowl with flour and mix.
4. While mixing, put butter into that vessel you used for liquids and melt in the microwave. __Tip: cover with something to avoid butter being everywhere__.
5. Mix in the butter until smooth.
6. Then use your waffle maker. There are two ways you can do that:
  1. Use low heat setting to make waffles that are chewy from outside to the inside.
  2. Use high heat setting to get waffle that are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.
