## Readwise

I was just hired as a Senior Growth Engineer at Readwise! This has been my dream for a long time ❤️

Excited to build a lot of cool stuff, there.

## Fatherhood

Being a father of a 10 month old is not an easy task, but I'm enjoying every second
of it, excluding the night time screaming. That part, sucks.

## Side Projects

In my free time, trying to grow my side projects bit by bit. Right now, the part that I need to learn is marketing.

## Writing

Trying to write more for my site. Sharing ideas and writing tutorials is hard for me, feels uncomfortable.
That means it is exactly what I need to do.
