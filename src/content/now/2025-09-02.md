## Readwise

Been working on Integration lately. If you want to export any of your Readwise highlights to a notetaking app, I'm responsible for it.

It's been a pain in the ass to debug at times, but i'm hoping all of this is worth it.

## Fatherhood

Being a father of a 2.5 yearl old is no easy task. But I'm enjoying it a lot. Seeing you son grow and try new things is an awesome exprience! 10/10. Definitely recommned.
I'm a lucky person that I can work from home and set my own working hours. This allows me not to miss a moment in his life.

## Side Projects

My main focus right now is Marketing Agents (though I'm trying to think of a better name since, i'm only focusing on blog content for now).

I do have a gazillion of ideas that I would like to bring to life, but time is limited and I'm trying to focus on something and make it super profitable!

It is definitely a challenge.

## Life

I'm currently in Moscow, Russia. Though this is my home and my family is here, it is becoming hard to enjoy myself.

- Troubles with wiring my salary here, to live on is a problem
- Constant battles with access to various sites
- Hard to get visas and generally buy tickets to travel outside

These are justa few things that make it hard to enjoy. So, we (my wife and I) are trying our best to come up with a long term plan that we can stick with. It's been hard.
